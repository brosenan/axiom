	    <p>Axiom provides a fresh new look at web applications.
	      Today, when building a web application, the application provider is responsible for everything.
	      Responsible for implementing correct business logic, responsible for performance, scale and availability.
	      They are also responsible for defining and implementing a privacy policy ensuring that private user data remains private.</p>

	    <p>Axiom is a <em>web platform</em>.
	      It is intended to be provided as a service, and handle most of the common concerns in
	      a web application: Scalability, availability and even confidentiality of user data.
	      Application providers upload their <em>business logic</em> to Axiom as <em>logic rules</em>,
	      written in Clojure.  Actually, the rules are written in a Clojure DSL we call <strong>Cloudlog</strong>.</p>
	    <p>Cloudlog is a <em>purely-declarative</em> DSL, based on a purely-declarative subset of Clojure.
	      Being purely declarative is important for two reasons:</p>
	    <ol><li>It keeps the application developer focused on <em>defining</em> the app's business logic rather than <em>implementing</em> it; and</li>
	      <li>It makes sure the application cannot <em>remember</em> user data.
		This is important to make Axiom itself responsible for the confidentiality of user data.</li></ol>

      <table><tr><td width="40%">
	    <p>This example demonstrates how an application is defined using Axiom.
	      This is a Twitter-like application named <em>tweetlog</em>.
	      Like Twitter, its main purpose is to show user <em>timelines</em> based on <em>tweets</em> made by users they <em>follow</em>.</p>
	    <p>In this example, we use two macros: <span class="code">defrule</span> and <span class="code">defclause</span> to define
	      <em>rules</em> and <em>clauses</em> respectively.</p>
	    <p>Rules and clauses both represent logic deductions (similar to Horn Clauses in Prolog).
	      Both rules and clauses operate on <em>facts</em>, which represent user data
	      (<span class="code">:tweetlog/follows</span> and <span class="code">:tweetlog/tweeted</span> in our example).</p>
	    <p>Both rules and clauses can leverage the power of Clojure through the use of <em>guards</em>.
	      Guards are pieces of Clojure code providing variable bindings and filtering through Clojure forms such as
	      <span class="code">(for)</span>, <span class="code">(let)</span> and <span class="code">(when)</span>.
	      In our example we use guards to extract user-handles mentioned in tweets.</p>
	    <p>The key difference between rules and clauses is the fact that the logic of a clause is applied at query time,
	      when the target query is already known, while the logic of a rule is applied at update time, as facts are added or removed.</p></td>
