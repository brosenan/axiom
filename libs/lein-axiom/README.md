# lein-axiom

A Leiningen plugin to do many wonderful things.

## Usage

FIXME: Use this for user-level plugins:

Put `[lein-axiom "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your `:user`
profile.

FIXME: Use this for project-level plugins:

Put `[lein-axiom "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your project.clj.

FIXME: and add an example usage that actually makes sense:

    $ lein axiom
