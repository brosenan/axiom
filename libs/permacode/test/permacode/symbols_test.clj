[[:chapter {:title "symbols: Extract symbols from expressions"}]]
"The `symbols` function is the key in our static analysis.  It takes a s-expression,
and returns a set of symbols defined by this s-expression."

"For Constants, it returns an empty set."
(fact 
 (symbols 2) => #{}
 (symbols true) => #{}
 (symbols "foo") => #{}
 (symbols :foo) => #{}
 (symbols nil) => #{}
 (symbols #"foobar") => #{}
 (symbols *ns*) => #{})

"For a symbol, `symbols` returns a set with that symbol."
(fact
 (symbols 'x) => #{'x})
"`symbols` goes into Clojure structures and aggergates symbols from there."
(fact
 (symbols '(+ a b)) => #{'+ 'a 'b}
 (symbols '[1 a 2 b]) => #{'a 'b}
 (symbols {'x 'y}) => #{'x 'y}
 (symbols #{'a 'b 3 4 5}) => #{'a 'b})

"In a `let*` special form, the bindings are removed from the returned set."
(fact
 (symbols '(let* [x 1 y 2] (+ x y))) => #{'+}
 (symbols '(let* [x a] x)) => #{'a})

"`symbols` expands macros, so it also handles the more familiar `let` form"
(fact
 (symbols '(let [x a] x a)) => #{'a} )

"`loop` is supported similarly."
(fact
 (symbols '(loop [x a y b] a x b y c)) => #{'a 'b 'c} )

"In the `fn*` special form (used by the `fn` macro) `symbols` removes the argument names from the set."
(fact
 (symbols '(fn [x y] (+ x y a))) => #{'a '+}
 (symbols '(fn foo [x y]  (+ x (foo y a)))) => #{'a '+})

"The function name (in named functions) is also removed."
(fact
 (symbols '(fn foo [x] (foo x))) => #{} )

"Multi-arity functions are supported as well."
(fact
 (symbols '(fn ([x] (+ a x))
             ([x y] (+ b x y)))) => #{'a 'b '+} )
"`def` is not allowed inside an expression (it is allowed on the top-level, as described below)."
(fact
 (symbols '(def x 2)) => (throws "def is not allowed") )

"Similarly, reference to variables is not allowed."
(fact
 (symbols '#'var) => (throws "vars are not allowed") )

"Quoted symbols are ignored."
(fact
 (symbols ''(a b c)) => #{} )

"In special forms such as `if` and `do`, the form's name is ignored."
(fact
 (symbols '(if a b c)) => #{'a 'b 'c}
 (symbols '(do a b c)) => #{'a 'b 'c}
 (symbols '(recur a b)) => #{'a 'b})

"Exceptions are not supported because they use Java interop."
(fact
 (symbols '(throw foo)) => (throws Exception "throw is not allowed. Use error instead")
 (symbols '(try foo bar baz)) => (throws "try/catch is not allowed"))

"While `for` is a macro and not a special form, its definition makes use of Java interop, which we disallow.
We therefore make `for` a special case."
(fact
 (symbols '(for [x foo] (* x 2))) => #{'foo '*})
